# 1Focus VSCode extension

## Setup

1. Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation).
2. Run `task setup` and wait until it prints `✔️ you are setup`.

The setup task verifies that `node`, `pnpm`, and the [`f` CLI](https://github.com/1focus-ai/f) are in your `PATH`, installs dependencies with `pnpm install`, and runs `pnpm build` so you know the toolchain works end-to-end.

## Commands

Run `task` to see all possible commands.
